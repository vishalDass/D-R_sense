“DIABETIC RETINOPATHY”. It is a condition which causes progressive damage to eye’s retina that if left untreated leads to blindness. In fact it is one of the leading cause of vision loss among working age adults. Moreover, if image processing techniques are to be utilized with the immense power of machine learning it really ensures a solution which is much more isolated from doctor’s intervention to identify the disease, which is exactly what our proposed system is intended to achieve. Using machine learning and image processing, we have developed an automated DR detection system to support doctors and patients. The system takes fundus images as an input. It extracts the lesions from the image by applying image processing techniques. This extracted information is processed by machine learning algorithms to classify the severity level of the disease. All the communication with the system is carried out through mobile application interface. The mobile application interface allows doctor to upload fundus images for diagnosis and view the results. Patients can also perform the diagnosis but the major focus is providing support in terms of finding the doctor, appointment fixtures and record maintenance.
